# Personal Schedule Keeper
This project dealt a lot with JavaScript's time functions, like getHour, getDay, and the sort. It is also the first time I made a project for someone's personal use.
Unlike my other projects, this one does not rely on bootstrap and instead uses my own CSS now that I know about breakpoints and the sort.
It also took under 24 hours to make, similar to the album app but the code is much cleaner and easier to navigate.
